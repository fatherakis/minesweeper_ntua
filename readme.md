# Minesweeper Java Project - ECE NTUA Course 2022-23

This project is a simple minesweeper game. It features game scenario creation and loading. 

On creation:
* you can choose between 2 different modes
* the mines within each level
* the time to complete the level. 

Furthermore, there is a SuperMine. If in the first 5 moves, the super-mine is flagged. Then all boxes in the same column and row are revealed/flagged. 

Finally, there is a game history with all previous games won or lost and a solution revealing the whole board and defining the game as lost.

The board mines generated in each game are saved in a text file, easily accessible for cheaters.


This whole project was done in IntelliJ IDE and is heavily recommended to simply load it there in order to run.
